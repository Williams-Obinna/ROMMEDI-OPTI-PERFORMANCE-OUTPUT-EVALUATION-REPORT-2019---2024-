Objective of the Project

The analyses focus on identifying key trends in patient as admissions, revenue distribution, and dominant medical conditions. The goal is to assess hospital performance, understand patient demographics, and evaluate insurance provider contributions to healthcare financing.

Insights:

1. Of the admitted Patients, 27,774 are male, and 27,226 are female.

2. The total income from all hospitals for the year amounts to $1,404,068,339.23.

3. Johnson Plc leads in revenue generation among hospitals, earning $1,084,203.

4. Medina and Elliott Stewards recorded the lowest financial performance, with a deficit of $2,633 for the year.

5. A significant increase in patient admissions occurred in 2020, with hospitals admitting 4,832 patients.

6. Hospitals earned a total of $286,359,751 from prescribing Ibuprofen.

7. The most frequently prescribed drugs in the year was Liptor, given to 11,140 patients.

8. Cigna insurance group disbursed $287,139,345 in medical claims, making it the top paying insurance provider.

9. Elective admissions accounted for 18,655 patients, the most common admission type.

Recommendations:

1. The gender distribution of admitted patients is nearly equal, This balance suggests equitable access to care across genders, but further analysis by medical condition could reveal gender specific trends.

2. While Lipitor was prescribed to more patients, Ibuprofen generated significant revenue, suggesting higher per-prescription revenue for Ibuprofen.

3. Elective admissions is the highest admission type, indicating a preference for scheduled procedures. This could be linked to high Arthritis cases.

4. While Cigna is the top contributor to hospital revenue, the patient service revenue across all insurance providers is balanced, with no single provider dominating significantly. The 2.8% difference indicates that hospitals are not overly reliant on one insurer, suggesting a diversified revenue stream.

5. Patient distribution across medical conditions is nearly uniform, with each affecting 9,000–9,200 patients, indicating a balanced burden.

CONCLUSION

Key learning:

· Middle-aged and older adults (51–70) generate highest patient service revenue (PSR), indicating that healthcare demand increases with age.

· Obesity, diabetes, and asthma contribute significantly to medical costs, emphasizing the need for preventive care strategies.

· After peaking in 2020, patient billing dropped significantly in 2024, which may be due to changing healthcare policies or improved outpatient care.
